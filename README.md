# JustAddWater

The end goal of this project is a timelapse video of a plant growing. To this end I am using a Raspberry Pi with a PiCamera and USB Webcam capable of doing 1280x720 still photos. I am also capturing temperature and humidity data with a DHT-22 sensor for possible later use. I have written up the details of this project in a document labeled Project.docx
The code is contained in three files named:
snapshot.py
processimages.py
dailysweep.py
Configuration data for the scripts can be found in:
settings.json
credentials.json
